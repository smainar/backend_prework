# Study Drills
# Hashes have their limitation. If order matters with your data, then you would
# use an array instead of a hash. Hashes can maintain order, but usually ordered
# items are stored in an array. If I needed a "stack" or a "queue" structure, then
# arrays are good at mimicking simple "first-in-first-out" queues, or "last-in-
# first-out" stacks.
