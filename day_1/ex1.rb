puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello Again"
puts "I like typing this."
puts "This is fun."
puts "Yay! Printing."
puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'
puts "This is another line."

Study Drills:
1) I did in line 8 by adding "puts" and the text that followed.
2) By putting the # in front of the lines, except for the last line (8), I made my script ring only one line.
3) I put the # (octothorpe) in front of the line to comment out the code.
