# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

Study Drills:
1) Yes, I was right that the # sign comments out the code. It's called octothorpe.
2) Yes, I reviewed each line and went backwards.
3) Yes, I found a couple mistakes and fixed them.
4) Yes, I read the code out loud.
