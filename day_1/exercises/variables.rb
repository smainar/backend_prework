# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You should be able to run this
# file from your terminal with the command `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# example: Write code below to save your name to a variable and
# print that variable to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
puts "#{name}"
my_name = "Stella Mainar"
puts "#{my_name}"

# Write code below to save the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# # print that variable to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
x = "friend to #{house_elf}"
puts "Harry Potter was a #{x}."
  # = Harry Potter was a friend to Dobby.

house_elf = "Dobby"
wizard = "the boy with the lightning bolt scar"
y = "#{house_elf} must save #{wizard}"
puts "#{y}, before it is too late."
  # = Dobby must save the boy with the lightning bolt scar, before it is too late.

# Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and print that variable to the terminal:
z = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogarts!"
puts "#{z}"

# example: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
# print the result:
students = 22
students += 2
puts "#{students + 2}"
  # = 26


# Write the code below to subract 2 students from the `students` variable and
# print the result:
puts "#{students - 2}"
  # = 22
