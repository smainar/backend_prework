## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
   The purpose of a method is to group one or more repeatable statements into one unit of code. It allows you
   to take that unit of code (common code) and execute it a myriad of ways in the program. It saves you time,
   because you don't have to keep writing your code over and over again.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
   def hello()
   puts "Sam I am"
   end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
   def hello_someone(name)
   puts "#{name} I am"
   end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
   hello_someone("Stella")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
